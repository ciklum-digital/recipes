# OnPush change detection

ALL your components should be marked with `OnPush` strategy.

This will allow you to have a total control over all data flows in your application. Codelyzer has introduced a new rule recently - [prefer-on-push-change-detection](http://codelyzer.com/rules/prefer-on-push-component-change-detection/). Use it!
